API for seat availability for an event


# Test Data
Event ID -- 1234 and 111.(Please find it in SeatRepositoryImpl)

# Swagger-UI URL
localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


Using one API to get seats/seats count. Could add more filters to get either only seats or seats count.
Added the logic to get seats/seats count separately in service layer to get the data independently.
